        <p>Confirming your identity helps us check it is really you making a claim – not someone pretending to be you. You will need to register and answer some questions about yourself.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">

            <li>an email address</li>
            <li>a mobile phone</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will also need information from 2 sources. You can choose from:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a valid UK passport</li>
            <li>payslips or P60</li>

        <!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
        <p>We will send security codes to your email and mobile phone to check that they belong to you.</p>
        <p>You will create a password, which you will use with your email address to sign in securely.</p>
        <p>We will ask some questions to check we are dealing with the right person and to protect you against fraud. We will then check this information against our records.</p>
        <p>Each time you sign in we will send a new security code to your mobile phone.</p> -->
